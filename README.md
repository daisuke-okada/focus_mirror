🪞 Focus Mirror — Reflect on how you really spend time

Focus Mirror helps you align how you intend to spend your time with how you actually do.
Declare your focus — “Learning for 2 hours” — and let Raycast quietly watch your activity across apps and Chrome tabs.
When your attention drifts, Focus Mirror gently nudges you back on track and helps you reflect with AI-assisted tagging and daily summaries.

✨ Features

🔍 Monitors your foreground apps and Chrome activity locally (no data leaves your Mac)

🧠 AI-based auto-tagging and natural-language correction (“this was research”)

⏳ Smart deviation detection (2-minute drift or 20% off-track)

📅 Calendar-aware focus suggestions (“Next up: 1h development session”)

🪄 Daily review with tag editing and reflection dashboard

🎯 Why it’s different
Unlike traditional focus tools that block distractions, Focus Mirror helps you understand your time and build intentional habits through awareness, not restriction.
