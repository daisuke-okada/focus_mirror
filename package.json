  "description": "🪞 Focus Mirror — Reflect on how you really spend time\n\nFocus Mirror helps you align how you intend to spend your time with how you actually do.\nDeclare your focus — “Learning for 2 hours” — and let Raycast quietly watch your activity across apps and Chrome tabs.\nWhen your attention drifts, Focus Mirror gently nudges you back on track and helps you reflect with AI-assisted tagging and daily summaries.\n\n✨ Features\n\n🔍 Monitors your foreground apps and Chrome activity locally (no data leaves your Mac)\n\n🧠 AI-based auto-tagging and natural-language correction (“this was research”)\n\n⏳ Smart deviation detection (2-minute drift or 20% off-track)\n\n📅 Calendar-aware focus suggestions (“Next up: 1h development session”)\n\n🪄 Daily review with tag editing and reflection dashboard\n\n🎯 Why it’s different\nUnlike traditional focus tools that block distractions, Focus Mirror helps you understand your time and build intentional habits through awareness, not restriction.",
